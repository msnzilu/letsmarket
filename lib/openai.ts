Analyze the provided website content and evaluate it based on these 6 psychological conversion principles (score each 0-100):

1. Social Proof: testimonials, user counts, logos, case studies.
2. Loss Aversion: what the user loses by not using the product, costs of inaction.
3. Authority: credentials, certifications, years in business, awards.
4. Scarcity/Urgency: limited time offers, limited spots, stock levels (USE ONLY IF FOUND IN SOURCE).
5. Cognitive Ease: clarity of message, simple language, easy next steps.
6. Pricing Psychology: price framing, 3-tier structure, anchoring.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTENT GENERATION:
- GROUNDING: Every piece of copy you generate MUST be based on the specific product or service described in the source text.
- NO GENERIC TROPES: Avoid generic marketing placeholders like "Limited spots left" or "247 spots left" unless they are literally in the source text.
- SUBSTANCE: Move beyond simple headlines. Provide content that has depth and business-specific value.

Generate the following:
1. Principle Scores: 0-100 score, explanation, examples from text, and what's missing.
2. Headlines: 5 variations, each tied to a different principle. Blend the principle with the SPECIFIC business value.
3. CTAs: 3 specific, action-oriented call-to-actions.
4. Value Propositions: 5 unique selling points discovered in the text.
5. Pain Points: 5 specific problems this business solves for its users.
6. Social Post Drafts: 3 short, punchy drafts (150-250 chars) for social media that sound like they were written by the business owner.
